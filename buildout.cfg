# Project buildout for isolated development and testing
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Pro Tip: If you are working on multiple projects, you can save some time by 
# using a home directory ".buildout" directory that specifies a "default.cfg"
# file. That way all your downloads are cached.
#
# Example: ~/.buildout/default.cfg
#
# [buildout]
# executable = /opt/python26/bin/python
# eggs-directory = /home/USERNAME/.buildout/eggs
# download-cache = /home/USERNAME/.buildout/downloads
# extends-cache = /home/USERNAME/.buildout/extends
#
#[omelette]
# location = /home/USERNAME/.buildout/omelette
